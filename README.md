# React application repo - this holds the production code that can be seen [running on Github Pages](http://hemmels.github.io/reactapp)
The running code is the gh-pages branch, which we never commit to directly, it is built from the master branch and pushed/deployed with 

    npm run deploy

This sends the code to be minified and sent to github pages.

Useful branch links: Codebase: [master](https://github.com/Hemmels/reactapp/tree/master) Prod code; [gh-pages](https://github.com/Hemmels/reactapp/tree/gh-pages)
You could also go to http://hemmels.github.io for a directory of all my Github Pages projects.
