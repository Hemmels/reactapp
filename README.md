# React application repo - this holds the production code that can be seen at http://hemmels.github.io/reactapp
We never interact with this project directly, it is built from the dev code project and pushed/deployed with npm start deploy.

Did you mean instead mean to go to http://hemmels.github.io for a directory of all my Github Pages projects?
